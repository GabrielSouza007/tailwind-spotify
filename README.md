The idea is:

This project is a UI clone of the Spotify web app, made with Tailwind CSS and React. The goal of this project is to practice and showcase my skills in front-end development, as well as to learn how to use Tailwind CSS, a utility-first framework that allows for fast and responsive design.

The project is not a fully functional app, but rather a static website that mimics the look and feel of Spotify web.

## Main technologies

- ReactJs
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- NextJs
- Git

## How to Run the Project Locally

   ```

3. Start the service in development mode:

   ```

4. Open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000 to view the running site. </br></br>
